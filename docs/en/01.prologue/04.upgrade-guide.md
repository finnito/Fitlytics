## Upgrading to 3.9.0 From 3.8

**Estimated Upgrade Time: 5 - 10 Minutes**

> We attempt to document every possible change. Since some of these changes are in obscure parts of the API only a portion of these changes may actually affect your application.{.notice}

Before continuing please refer to the [release notes](../prologue/release-notes) to see more information on what has been changed.

### Updating Dependencies

Update your `composer.json` file by removing `wikimedia/composer-merge-plugin` and `anomaly/streams-composer-plugin` from your requirements. Match versions for core packages for all other addons and dependencies: https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms/blob/3.9/composer.json#L24-L84

Of course, don't forget to examine any additional addons and packages consumed by your application and verify you are using the proper version for PyroCMS 3.9 support.

### Remove Core References

Core addons are now loaded as "native" addons via the addition of the native addon path loader. Core addons will continue to be supported, but collide with Composer 2 and the future of PyroCMS. Addons go in the vendor directory. See below for project/one-off addons.
